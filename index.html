              <h1>How we work</h1>
              <p>We have several steps we use to get from an idea to a valided product. These are best practices validated at the startups we have done in the past. Succesful startups not only have a Product/Market Fit but also focus on a fit with the Channel and achieving network effects.</p>
              <p><img src="img/PMF.png" width="300" Height="150" alt="product/market/channel/model fit"></p>
              <h3>Business Model Canvas</h3>
              <p>We transform the idea or concept to a business model by bringing al aspects into focus. This gives a good insight of all the aspects that play a role in the startup and the chance of success.
                You can view the <a href="img/business_model_canvas_poster.pdf" style="color:black"><b>Business Model Canvas</b></a>. It is just an A4 that needs to be filled out, no big business plans!</p>
              <h3>Business Value Proposition</h3>
              <p>An important part of the Business Model Canvas is the Business Value Proposition. The questions that should be answered are: what are the pains and gains that will be solved by this solution. How does our product add value to its stakeholders (the customer).</p>
              <h3>Lean Startup Cycle</h3>
              <p>We make use of the Lean Startup Cycle to get as fast as possible to a product market fit and customer. The cyscle consist of 3 steps: Build, Measure and Learn. It's goal is to test the uncerainties that are part of the business model.
                By testing a minimal viable product on customers you can learn from their behavior and adapt your product to the needs of the customers.</p>
                <p>The most important thing to do is to define the uncertainties and asumptions you want to test and make a minimal viable product that can give answers to those uncertainties. You can measure the beavior and learn from it.
                  After a few cycles you should be getting closer to a product that fulfills the needs of the customers. The minimal viable product is a minimal version of the product. You can use minimal resources since you do not know what the outcome of
                  the test is going to be.</p>
